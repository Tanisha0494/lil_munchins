<p>The owners of Lil' Munchkins are the wonderful Jill Foster-Rhodes and Jody Rhodes who founded it in 2003. They both have degrees in education and child psychology so they know what children like and gravitate and making the curriculum more focused in those area.</p>

<p>Jill and Jody open Lil' Munchkins to give children a more personable and fun educational rather than what most schools and daycares teach. They wanted to focus more in creativity and exploration. These ideas make the school a more open environment which is exactly what they wanted.</p>

<p>Our owners are both artistic and explorers. They love traveling and learning new activities and crafts they can bring back to school and teach your munchkins. They feel that traveling and learning new things is a great way to expand and get a more worldwide view on things. </p>

<p>They love hearing your feedback. You can call them at 619-209-8920 or email Jill (jfoster@gmail.com) or Jody (jrhodes@gmail.com) personally. They'll be happy to anwser any question you have as well.</p>
