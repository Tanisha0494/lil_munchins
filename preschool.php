<p>As you know hands-on exploration activities are one thing you're lil munchkin loves right now. We have that and much more to nuture their need for challenges, motivation, and encouragement.</p>

<p>That nuturing happens by keeping a free yet structured environment. In our munchkin community we fin it important that they respect each other and gain self-confidence, so the transition to kindergarten will be seamless.</p>

<h2>The activites we do are a foundation for:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Pre-reading skills</li>
	<li>Pre-writing</li>
	<li>Pre-math skills</li>
	<li>Physical coordination</li>
	<li>Social Skills i.e. focusing and team work</li>
</ul>

<p>We will keep you informed about what's going on at Lil' Munchkins and there will be three parent-teacher conferences to update you on the progress of your munchkin.</p>
