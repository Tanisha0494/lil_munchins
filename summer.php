<p>Summer Fun is a big deal for you and your munchkin. While you're busy at work, we'll take on having a blast with your munchkin. Our summer camp lasts from July to August when we open up school again after our summer break.</p>

<p>At summer camp your munchkin will be involved with a ton of summer games. They'll watch summer movies and learn through summer related lessons. We try and make it a fun and educational experience for all the munchkins that join us for our summer camp.</p>

<h2>Don't want to do the full summer camp?</h2>
<p>No problem we'll be having many events during this time, you and your munchkin are always welcome to join in on the summer fun with us.</p>
